    <h2><u>Description</u></h2>
    <P>Pizza is a popular and versatile dish that originated in Italy but has become a beloved food worldwide. It typically consists of a round, flattened base of dough topped with tomato sauce, cheese, and various toppings, which can include meats, vegetables, and herbs. The dough is traditionally made with wheat flour, water, yeast, and olive oil, giving it a chewy yet crisp texture when baked in a hot oven.</P>
    <h2><u>Ingredients</u></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 package (2 1/4 teaspoons) active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups warm water (110째F/45째C)</li>
        <li>3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
        </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>Pizza sauce</li>
        <li>Shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>Toppings of your choice (e.g., pepperoni, mushrooms, bell peppers, onions, olives)</li>
        <li>Cornmeal or flour (for dusting)</li>
        <li>Optional seasonings (e.g., garlic powder, oregano, basil)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2><u>Instructions</u></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the pizza dough by combining warm water, yeast, sugar, and olive oil in a bowl. Let it sit for about 5 minutes until the yeast activates.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, mix flour and salt, then gradually add the wet ingredients, stirring until a dough forms.</li>
        <li>Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 5-7 minutes, then place it in a greased bowl, cover it with a damp towel, and let it rise for about an hour or until it doubles in size.</li>
        <li>Preheat your oven to the highest temperature it can reach, usually around 500째F (260째C).</li>
        <li>Roll out the dough on a floured surface to your desired thickness, then transfer it to a baking sheet or pizza stone.</li>
        <li>Top the dough with pizza sauce, cheese, and toppings of your choice.</li>
        <li>Bake the pizza in the preheated oven for about 10-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly and melted.</li>
        <li>Remove the pizza from the oven, let it cool for a few minutes, then slice and enjoy!</li>
      </ol>
