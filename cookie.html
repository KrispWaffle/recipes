    <h2><u>Description</u></h2>
    <p>
        To make cookies, you'll need basic ingredients like flour, sugar, butter, eggs, and baking powder. Start by creaming together softened butter and sugar until the mixture is light and fluffy. Then, beat in eggs one at a time, followed by any flavorings like vanilla extract. In a separate bowl, mix flour with baking powder and a pinch of salt. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until a dough forms. You can also add chocolate chips, nuts, or other mix-ins at this point.
    </p>
    <p>Next, scoop the dough onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, spacing the cookies a few inches apart. Bake in a preheated oven according to the recipe instructions, usually around 350°F (175°C) for 8-12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden brown. Let the cookies cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Enjoy your homemade cookies with a glass of milk or pack them up for a sweet treat on the go!</p>
